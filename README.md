**TARGET</H3>**
>This application will target current casual carpool users in the Bay Area. Currently the casual carpool community utilizes predetermined pick-up spots where both drivers and riders meet without prior knowledge of each other and at random. A typical interaction amongst drivers and riders starts at the moment of pickup at the predetermined locations without prior knowledge of who they are riding with.
We have identified and opportunity to provide both drivers and riders of the casual carpool a chance to determine who they ride with prior to their pick-up times.

**HOW</H3>**
>By creating an app that has user profiles that define musical taste, film choices, and different types of interest and hobbies we believe that the carpooling experience can be more enjoyable. People of similar interest can in this fashion gravitate towards one another with the certainty that their musical choices are going to be pleasant and that they can converse and share topics that everyone likes.

Once users of the casual carpool start to gravitate towards each other motivated by their musical taste and hobbies we believe that the app can provide a platform so that the casual carpool is not rooted in a predetermined physical location, but that users themselves will begin to communicate with members of their carpooling community to plan rides before hand and to define their own unique pickup locations. 

**WHY</H3>**
>There are current apps in the market that cater to the car pooling community but they are by in large not free and don’t really address the ideal of creating community within interest groups. The integration of social media such as Facebook and location services such as Google Maps offers an opportunity to make the carpooling experience an enjoyable and social experience where people of like mind commune while traveling together. 

Another aspect that is often overlooked while utilizing the casual carpool is the fact that people don’t know who they are riding with. Anonymity can be a factor for creating a bit of anxiety and a rather aloof and cold environment. Negative aspects of riding in an anonymous environment can be tolerated when rides are short and when the presence of multiple riders can help neutralize an unpleasant input. On the other hand, when rides are long and when a particular person is inconsiderate or rude, this can be a troublesome predicament.
